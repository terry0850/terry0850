- 👋 Hi, I’m @terry0850. Currently, I am working as an investment manager in NYC.
- 👀 I’m interested in the transparency of the overal financial market and development/advancement of financial systems, ultimately creating one unified global market for everyone.     
- 🌱 I’m currently (trying to) learning computer science and python! Never learned coding before (except basic VBA in excel :/).
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on developing a data system to synchronously download data from the government entities (e.g. SEC, BLS, Fed). 
- 📫 Email terry0850@gmail.com if you want to discuss my vision and work together!
